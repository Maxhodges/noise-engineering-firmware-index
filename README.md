# noise-engineering-firmware-index
A comprehensive index of firmware available for Noise Engineering's Versio and Alia platforms.

## Description
This repository maintains a curated list of firmware for Noise Engineering's open platform modules (Versio and Alia), including both official and third-party firmware. The goal is to help the modular synthesis community discover and track available firmware options.

## Official Firmware
The Versio platform is a line of stereo DSP modules with interchangeable firmware, allowing users to transform a single module into various effects by simply updating the firmware. Each version offers a unique sound-processing approach, from lush reverbs to gritty distortions.

### Versio Platform
- Yester Versio: Tape-style delay with feedback and warmth.
- Ampla Versio: Voltage-controlled amplifier and distortion with dynamics control.
- Desmodus Versio: Atmospheric reverb with a haunting, otherworldly character.
- Electus Versio: Reverse reverb with experimental ambient textures.
- Imitor Versio: Multitap delay with up to 12 customizable delay lines.
- Lacrima Versio: Stereo resonant filter with dynamic modulation and phaser effects.
- Melotus Versio: Granular processor for time-stretching and stuttering sounds.
- Polydactyl Versio: Multiband dynamics processor for compression and expansion.
- Ruina Versio: Brutal distortion and wavefolding for extreme sound mangling.

### Alia Platform
The Alia platform features compact, versatile digital oscillators designed for Eurorack, offering a range of synthesis techniques and sounds. These modules excel at everything from harsh and aggressive tones to complex and melodic textures.

- Ataraxic Iteritas Alia: Noise-based oscillator with metallic and gritty timbres, ideal for percussion and industrial sounds.
- Basimilus Iteritas Alia: Versatile percussive synthesizer capable of crafting everything from tight kicks to rich, tonal drums.
- Cursus Iteritas Alia: Additive oscillator with rich spectral control for organic and evolving harmonic sounds.
- Debel Iteritas Alia: Complex phase distortion oscillator for creating unique, angular, and textured tones.
- Incus Iteritas Alia: Focused on sharp, metallic, and bell-like tones, great for cutting leads or percussive elements.
- Manis Iteritas Alia: Brutal and aggressive oscillator designed for harsh, distorted, and chaotic sounds.
